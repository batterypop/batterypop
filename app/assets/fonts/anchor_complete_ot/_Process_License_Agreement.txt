FONT SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
--------------------------------

This License Agreement is a legal contract between you and the Process Type Foundry, LLC ("Process"). When you purchase a font, you are purchasing the right to use that font under a particular set of conditions. These conditions range from, for example, how many computers the font can be installed on to whether it can be embedded in digital documents. It is important that you read and understand this Agreement because it defines your rights, the acceptable uses of our Fonts, and the rights Process reserves. If you believe your situation or need is not addressed, or if you are unsure of any section's meaning, please ask us before you make a purchase.

Once you download and/or install and/or use the Process Type Foundry Fonts, you are confirming you understand and agree to the terms of this Agreement, and that you have the authority to bind the person or entity specified on your sales receipt to the terms of this Agreement. Upon payment in full, the Process Type Foundry grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our Fonts under the following terms and conditions.
